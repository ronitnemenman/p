        My name is Ronit Nemenman. I am a mostly 2D artist based in Atlanta, Georgia. My materials range from working charcoal, acrylics, watercolors, and more as I like to experiment with almost every piece I make. My work has been featured in the following <a href="exhibits.html">exhibitions</a>.
                </p> -->
                <p>
                    I have drawn to the arts since I was just 5 years old taking classes at Red Wall Art Studio. Over the past ten years, I have been able to continue practicing at various other art classes and schools, but most recently I have been at Chamblee High School. From there I have made dozens of pieces, had work in many exhibitions, and been able to help my community through art.
