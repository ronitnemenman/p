                        Golden Box was the visual representation of my feelings after my grandfathers death. I pushed myself into escapism until I hit a breaking point, until I couldn't stop remembering. The same way the poem itself is in black and white and while the box is almost entirely insonspicous its gold coloring draws your eye. You know its important no matter how plain in shape and style it is.

                A golden box and stories<br>
                Are all I have left<br>
                ...<br>
                Soaked tissues in my pocket<br>
                A pocket knife you cherished<br>
                ...<br>
                The stories kept me alive<br>
                I only felt smiles that barely held<br>
                Only felt tears not for me<br>
                ...<br>
                I cried for you<br>
                I cried because I haven't let myself<br>
                I cried because I realized I was alone<br>
                I cried in the dark with a closed door<br>
                Protected from the world<br>
                I cried with music blasting<br>
                ...<br>
                I cried for the stories I heard<br>
                In front of a golden box<br>
                And a wreath of flowers<br>
                ...<br>
                That golden box into the ground<br>
                The one with your name on it<br>
                And you inside it<br>

                        After working in charcoal for about a week, the piece was ready to seal and co over in water soluble crayon to create a subtle but unmistakable gold.

                    Using a ruler I wrote as much of the poem as I could to create a blurred but meangful background for the piece.
